                Gohan’s character arc in *Dragon Ball Z* is a prime example of missed potential. After his incredible transformation during the Cell Saga, fans were eager to see how he would evolve as a warrior and leader. Unfortunately, the creators decided to pivot Gohan’s character, steering him away from the path of a formidable fighter. Instead of becoming the next protector of Earth, he was relegated to a supporting role, leaving viewers wondering what could have been.

                After the defeat of Cell, Gohan was arguably at the peak of his abilities. The combination of his latent power and newfound confidence set the stage for a compelling storyline. However, when he returned in the Buu Saga, fans were met with a version of Gohan who had shifted his priorities. The introduction of his alter ego, the Great Saiyaman, was met with mixed reactions. While it added a humorous layer to his character, it also detracted from the serious warrior he had become during the Cell Games.

                As a result, many fans feel that Gohan's story was left unfinished. The potential for Gohan to take center stage was lost, and his character was overshadowed by Goku’s return. Instead of exploring the complexities of Gohan’s role in the *Dragon Ball* universe, the series opted for familiar territory with Goku. This left many viewers wishing for an alternate timeline where Gohan truly stepped into the limelight, leading a new generation of warriors with strength and wisdom.
